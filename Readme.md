# KIET Tech Society Website

Welcome to the official website repository for the **KIET Tech Society**, the premier technical club of the KIET Group of Institutions. This project was designed to demonstrate core web development concepts including semantic HTML, CSS styling, Flexbox, and Floats.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a multi-page static website that serves as a digital portal for the club. It allows users to learn about the club's history, view upcoming technical events, and submit an application to join the society.

### Key Features
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Seamless navigation between Home, About, Events, and Join pages.
* **Responsive Layout:** Uses CSS Flexbox for aligning event cards.
* **Legacy Support:** Demonstrates the use of CSS `float` for image alignment on the About page.
* **User Interaction:** Includes a functional-looking HTML form for student registration.
* **Consistent Styling:** Uses a centralized `style.css` file for a uniform look and feel (KIET Blue & White theme).
